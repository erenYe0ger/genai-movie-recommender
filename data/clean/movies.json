A number of other international soccer stars were soon lured to the Cosmos, including Franz Beckenbauer, Rodney Marsh, and Carlos Alberto, but with the turn of the decade, the team began losing favor with fans and folded in 1985.","tagline":"The untold story of the team that had America at its feet.","title":"Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos","production_companies":[],"cast":["Pel\u00e9","Franz Beckenbauer","Carlos Alberto","Raphael de la Sierra","Phil Woosnam","Jay Emmett","Werner Roth","Peppe Pinton","Giorgio Chinaglia","Shep Messing"],"crew":["Paul Crowder","John Dower"]},{"genres":["Drama","Adventure","Documentary"],"id":201132,"keywords":["biography","antarctica"],"overview":"Filling the giant screen with stunning time-lapse vistas of Antarctica, and detailing year-round life at McMurdo and Scott Base, Anthony Powell\u2019s documentary is a potent hymn to the icy continent and the heavens above.","tagline":"Step Outside The Box","title":"Antarctica: A Year on Ice","production_companies":["Antzworks"],"cast":["Genevieve Bachman","William Brotman","Michael Christiansen","Tom Hamann","George Lampman","Peter Lund","Keri Nelson","Casey O'Brien","Anthony Powell","Andrew Velman"],"crew":["David Donaldson","Plan 9","Anthony Powell","Janet Roddick","Steve Roche"]},{"genres":["Drama","Action"],"id":112456,"keywords":["skateboarding","forgiveness","sport","family relationships","aftercreditsstinger"],"overview":"Hardflip follows the story of Caleb (Randy Wayne) a young skater whose ill mother (Rosanna Arquette) and absent father (John Schneider) leave him reaching for the only hope he has...becoming a sponsored skater.
